This test is a simple load-store test that tests your CPU's scheduling by repeatedly
reading from and writing to the same register, while issuing multiple ALU ops.
Here is the hex translated into instructions:

MOVZ 34 -> R3
MOVZ 10 -> R4
ADD (R4, 10) -> R4
SUB (R3, 1) -> R3
B (off = -2) cond = NE
HLT

The expected output of this program is for R4 to have the value 10 + 34*10 = 350
