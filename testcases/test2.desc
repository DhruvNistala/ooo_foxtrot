This test is another simple R/W case which calculates Fibonacci
numbers. It also tests your conditional select.

MOVZ 30 -> R3
MOVZ 1 -> R4
MOVZ 1 -> R5
CSEL (always) R5->R4
ADDS (R4, R5) -> R5
SUB (R3, 1) -> R3
B (off = -3) cond = NE
HLT

This will calculate the 31st Fibonacci number in R5. Change the value (n) that R3
is initialized to in order to calculated the (n+1)th Fib number.
